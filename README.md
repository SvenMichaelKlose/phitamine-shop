# Overview

This is a web shop for precious stamps created with
phitamine and centralservices.  It pitches phitamine's nifty
URL schema for multiple ports, a cart with undo and a CSS
upload form for your favourite design artists.

You need the tr√© programming language on some Unix with
'git' and 'docker-compose' installed.

# Running it

Run 'install-modules.sh' to clone all required modules into
directory 'tre_modules'.

Run 'make.sh' and you'll find a huge index.php in a newly
create directory called 'compiled'.

Step into 'compiled' and run 'sudo docker-compose up'. When
that's up, install the database by running
'mysql -u root -p -h 0.0.0.0 fnord <init.sql'.
The password is 'fnord'.  Now you can browse the empty shop
at address http://localhost:19020.

The username and password for the admin area is both 'pixel'.

# Problems

The CSS is out of date and needs to be redone, preferably
with Flexbox.

# Wanted features

* Automatic URL rewrite in CSS through script, using
  *BASE-URL*.
